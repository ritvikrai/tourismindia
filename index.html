							<h3>Sarnath</h3>
							<p>
								◽◽◽◽◽<br>
								Sarnath is a place located 10 kilometres north-east of Varanasi near the confluence of the Ganges and the Varuna rivers in Uttar Pradesh, India. The Deer Park in Sarnath is where Gautama Buddha first taught the Dharma, and where the Buddhist Sangha came into existence through the enlightenment of Kondanna (Sanskrit: Kauṇḍinya).
								<br />◽◽◽◽◽<br>It is home to the iconic Sarnath Mandir and Dhamek Stupa.
								<br />◽◽◽◽◽<br>Although Hinduism has a stronghold in Varanasi, Buddhism has a major presence in this village in the district of Varanasi.

							<h3>Shri Kashi Vishwanath Temple</h3>
							<p>
								◽◽◽◽◽<br>
								Hindu pilgrims and tourists alike travel for thousands of miles to reach the Shri Kashi Vishwanath Temple, a sacred attraction around four kilometers from the Varanasi Junction railway station near the Manikarnika Ghat. The impressive structure, dedicated to the Hindu deity Shiva, has earned the nickname "The Golden Temple" for its striking spire – plated in some 800 kilograms of pure gold. The distinctive design of this temple has gone on to inspire the architecture of hundreds of other temples across India.
								<br />◽◽◽◽◽<br>
								Strict security measures around the complex require that tourists stash their cameras, phones, bags, and other belongings in a rentable locker nearby. Expect to ditch your shoes and wait in line with hundreds of other visitors, all eager to touch the 60-centimeter-tall, sin-absolving Shiva lingam in a silver alter. It's an intense, yet rewarding experience
								<br />◽◽◽◽◽<br>
								Hot tip: Skip this attraction on Hindu holidays, when devotees wait in line for up to two full days to enter the temple.
								<br />◽◽◽◽◽<br>
								Address: Lahori Tola, Varanasi

							<h3>Assi Ghat</h3>
							<p>
								◽◽◽◽◽<br>
								When it comes to famous places to visit in Varanasi, the city's southernmost main ghat regularly tops the list. Assi Ghat's star attraction is a Shiva lingam (phallic representation of the Hindu deity) beneath a sacred fig tree. It draws hundreds of pilgrims every day, who come to worship Lord Shiva after rinsing in the Ganges River.
								<br />◽◽◽◽◽<br>
								Feeling a little stiff from traveling? Swing by Assi Ghat at sunrise, when you can get your downward-facing dog on with dozens of others during morning yoga accompanied by live music every day. Tourists can also see another Ganga Aarti performance here in the evening, which is slightly smaller and more intimate than the one at Dasaswamedh Ghat.

							<h3>Sankat Mochan Hanuman Temple</h3>
							<p>
								◽◽◽◽◽<br>
								Situated on the banks of the Assi River, the Sankat Mochan Hanuman Temple draws thousands of visitors a day, all eager to make an offering of sweets and flowers to the Hindu god Hanuman. Legend has it that this temple was constructed exactly where Hindu saint and poet Goswami Tulsidas had a vision of the monkey god. Speaking of monkeys, keep your eye out for the mischievous creatures who are regularly spotted bouncing around the temple.
								<br />◽◽◽◽◽<br>
								Hot tip: April or May can be a particularly great time to visit this Varanasi attraction. That's when the temple hosts its annual "Sankat Mochan Sangeet Samaroh," a festival of classical music and dance recitals held over a series of five to six days. Performers come from all over the world to take part in the nearly 100-year-old event.

							<h3>Ramnagar Fort</h3>
							<p>
								◽◽◽◽◽<br>
								There are few destinations in India without a fort, and Varanasi is no exception. About 14 kilometers from the city center, you'll find Ramnagar Fort. The 18th-century sandstone fort and palace is no longer used as a defensive structure, but instead houses a quirky museum brimming with vintage automobiles, elaborate hookahs, antique weapons, sedan chairs decked out in jewels, and a one-of-a-kind astronomical clock that's more than 150 years old.
								<br />◽◽◽◽◽<br>
								After enjoying an archeological treasure hunt at the museum, check out the fort's temples, one of which honors Veda Vyasa, author of the Mahabharata and other important Hindu epics.

							<h3>Dasaswamedh Ghat</h3>
							<p>
								◽◽◽◽◽<br>
								The lively atmosphere of the Dasaswamedh Ghat makes it one of the best places to visit in Varanasi. This tourist attraction is a swirling hodgepodge of flower sellers touting bright blossoms, boat operators hawking rides along the Ganges River, and sadhus (holy men) with face paint. You can spend hours people watching in this area during the day.
								<br />◽◽◽◽◽<br>
								Hindu priests put on the Ganga Aarti every night at the Dasaswamedh Ghat, starting at around 7pm. Donning saffron-hued robes, the priests spread out plates of flower petals and other offerings and blow a conch shell to signal the start of the spiritual ceremony. Thousands of tourists gather to watch the priests chant and wave tiered plates of sandalwood-scented incense in intricate patterns for about 45 minutes. It's an extravagant sight and one of the top things to do here.
								<br />◽◽◽◽◽<br>
								Hot tip: Get to the ghat at least a couple of hours early if you want to beat the crowds and score a great spot for the show. You can also get incredible views from boats along the river or in shop balconies above the ghat.
								<br />◽◽◽◽◽<br>
								Address: Dasaswamedh Ghat Road, Bangali Tola, Varanasi
